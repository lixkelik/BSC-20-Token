# Shrimp Token is a BSC-20-Token
This repository is meant for my personal use to learn how to make token with solidity language that runs on BEP-20.
I called this Shrimp token, that runs on Binance Smart Chain.

I'm using 0.8.2 solidity Compiler

## shrimptokenv1
This version of code is my very first code in solidty.
It works perfectly to deploy the smart contract, i tried it at bsc testnet.
The sc address: 0xd5C8687077889EbeF8Ba33b0fA38343f5ECB2FE5

But, i face some bugs, where when i tried to send it to another wallet, it will send like 0.0000...
i think there's some problem with the decimals things.
Another issues is that it won't show the balance in metamask. I think its because the decimal problem too,
where its really small so it won't show the real balance on my metamask.

I will figure it out later when i knew more about this language. I will create another code, shrimptokenv2  :D!
